## Data & Metrics

### Synthetic datasets (CSV/Text)
- `data/instagram_monthly.csv`: club_id, club_name, year, month, posts, likes, reach
- `data/whatsapp_monthly.csv`: club_id, club_name, year, month, messages, sentiment, active_members
- `data/attendance_events.csv`: club_id, club_name, year, month, event_name, attendees
- `data/awards_won.csv`: club_id, club_name, year, month, award_name, level
- `data/reports/club_<id>.txt`: per-club textual history report used for report scoring

These datasets are generated by a script and read directly during ranking (no DB storage required for these metrics).

### Generate synthetic datasets
```bash
# from project root
python scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py
```
This creates/updates all CSVs and the `data/reports/` folder.

### Ranking computation
- Rankings are computed per award using normalized components and weights from `EvaluationWeights`.
- Reports metric is derived from `data/reports/club_<id>.txt` with a simple keyword-based heuristic.
- Weights include: `w_social`, `w_whatsapp`, `w_awards`, `w_feedback`, `w_attendance`, `w_reports`.

  #### Scoring formula
- All components are normalized to [0, 1] across eligible clubs for the selected award.
- Components:
  - `social = average( norm(posts), norm(likes), norm(reach) )`
  - `whatsapp = 0.7 * norm(messages) + 0.3 * norm(sentiment)`
  - `awards = norm(awards_won)`
  - `feedback = norm(vote_count_for_this_award)`
  - `attendance = norm(offline_attendance)`
  - `reports = norm(report_score)`

Final score per club:

```
score = w_social * social
      + w_whatsapp * whatsapp
      + w_awards * awards
      + w_feedback * feedback
      + w_attendance * attendance
      + w_reports * reports
```

### Database Tables (core)
- `User`, `Club`, `Award`, `Nomination`, `FeedbackVote`, `EvaluationWeights`, `AwardDecision`

### Sample Data
The application comes with pre-loaded sample data:
- 12 different clubs across various categories
- 8 award categories with specific criteria
- Admin user account for management
